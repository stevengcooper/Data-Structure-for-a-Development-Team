# Data Structure for a Development Team

## Description

The data structure allows a developer to enter a time entry for every task completed on a project, and to document the structure of the developer's grouping as well as the client. The user as well as the development team are allowed to comment on the client, project, and industry they are working on.

## Follow your Team's progress from Start to Finish:
  1. Document every step of every Project:
    * Developers track their hours on every step.
    * Every task can have multiple sub tasks.
    * Every Project can have multiple tasks.
  2. Track which Teams are working on which elements of the Project
    * Track which Developers are working on which Teams.
    * Teams can have the ability to:
        * Keep notes on the Project.
        * Update notes on the Client.
        * Write about the Client's Industry.
  3. Project Managers can communicate Client information to the Development Teams:
    * Keep your Teams up to date with changes in the Client's needs and wants.
  4. Allow your Company to be more efficient in the completion of Projects.
    * Your Clients get the deliverables they want.
    * You have documentation of the work completed for the billing process.
